    "The Pillars of Creation are a striking feature within the Eagle Nebula (M16), located approximately 6,500 light-years away from Earth. These massive columns of gas and dust are regions of active star formation, sculpted by the intense radiation and stellar winds from nearby young stars.",
    facts: "The Pillars of Creation were immortalized in a famous image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995, revealing their intricate details and the birth of new stars within. Each pillar is several light-years in length and houses stellar nurseries where young stars are born. The radiation from massive stars located just outside the pillars erodes the surrounding gas and dust, shaping them into their distinctive formations. Despite their beauty, the Pillars of Creation are transient structures, as the young stars they birth eventually disperse the surrounding material through their own stellar winds and radiation."
